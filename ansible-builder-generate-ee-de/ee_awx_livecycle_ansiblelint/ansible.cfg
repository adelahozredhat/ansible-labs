# Use an explicit inventory for linting
# This points to a non-existent or minimal file path.
# The trailing comma tells Ansible to treat "localhost" as a hostname, 
# not a file, which is often sufficient for a syntax check.
inventory = localhost,

# You can also use a simple placeholder file like:
# inventory = ./inventory.dummy
